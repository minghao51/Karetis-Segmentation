# Karetis-Segmentation

**Objective**

This repo is meant to provide supporting codes, algorithm setup, notebook for the introduction slides on Machine Learning : Segmentation. (To be linked). Please go throught the document for the context of ML segmentation. 

**Preview**

The rendered Rnotebook can be viewed online (through browser) with the following link
[Rendered KM_Segmentation.html](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/minghao51/Karetis-Segmentation/blob/master/KM_Segmentation_Simplified.html).

Do note that the whole repo can be downloaded and run locally, all the required R codes can all be found in the [.Rmd file](https://github.com/minghao51/Karetis-Segmentation/blob/master/KM_Segmentation_Simplified.Rmd). This may be the best route if the intention is to test the algorithm/techniques on custom data.

**Highlights**

- The sample data can be found in the \Data folder
- The codes can be found in the KM_Segmentation_Simplified.Rmd file (please use Rstudio to open it)
- The rendered html version of the codes and short description can be found at the KM_Segmentation_Simplified.html
